# CU Japanese and Japanese American Community History Project
## Description
The CU Japanese &amp; Japanese American Community History Project documents the history of Japanese and Japanese American students, faculty, and staff at the University of Colorado.

This project is generously supported by the CU Boulder Outreach Committee.
