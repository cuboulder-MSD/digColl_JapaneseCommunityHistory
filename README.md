# CU Japanese and Japanese American Community History Project
## Description
The CU Japanese &amp; Japanese American Community History Project documents the history of Japanese and Japanese American students, faculty, and staff at the University of Colorado.

This collection contains documents, photos, audio and video recordings, and other materials from the University Librariesâ€™ Archives, as well as oral history interviews conducted by CU Boulder students working on the project. This project is generously supported by the CU Boulder Outreach Committee.
