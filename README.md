# digColl_JapaneseCommunityHistory
The CU Japanese &amp; Japanese American Community History Project documents the history of Japanese and Japanese American students, faculty, and staff at the University of Colorado. The project began in 2019 to celebrate the long and vibrant history of this university community and to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the end of Japanese American incarceration in the United States. This collection contains documents, photos, audio and video recordings, and other materials from the University Librariesâ€™ Archives, as well as oral history interviews conducted by CU Boulder students working on the project. This project is generously supported by the CU Boulder Outreach Committee.
